## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **No Files Found**: Ensure your music directories are correctly configured in Settings.
- **Slow Indexing**: For large collections, use the "Extract Audio Metadata" option to toggle faster indexing without audio analysis.
- **Match Quality**: Adjust the similarity threshold in the Settings or Search tab if matches are too strict or too loose.
- **Auto-Selection Not Working**: üÜï Check that auto-selection is enabled in Settings and that your minimum score threshold isn't too high.
- **Poor Auto-Selection Results**: üÜï Adjust format preferences and score tolerance in Settings to better match your collection and preferences.
- **Bulk Copy Failures**: üÜï Ensure destination folder exists and you have write permissions. Check logs for specific error details.
- **Backup Creation Fails**: üÜï Ensure you have write permissions to the backup destination and sufficient disk space.
- **Restore Operation Fails**: üÜï Verify backup integrity first, ensure the application has write permissions to database location.
- **Theme Not Applying**: If the theme doesn't change immediately, try saving settings and restarting the application.

### Performance Tips

- **Large Collections**: Use fast indexing mode for initial setup, then re-index with full metadata when needed
- **Large Playlists**: Auto-selection handles hundreds of entries efficiently, but very large playlists (1000+ entries) may take a few seconds
- **Network Storage**: Local storage performs better than network-attached storage for bulk operations
- **Regular Backups**: üÜï Create backups regularly - they're much faster than re-indexing large collections
- **Incremental Indexing**: üÜï Subsequent indexing runs are much faster as they only process new/changed files

### Data Protection

- **Backup Before Major Changes**: Always create a backup before upgrading, changing settings, or moving files
- **Verify Backups**: Use the "Verify Backup Integrity" feature to ensure your backups are valid
- **Multiple Backup Locations**: Store backups in different locations (local, cloud, external drive) for maximum protection
- **Test Restores**: Periodically test restore operations to ensure your backup strategy works

### Logs

Logs are stored in the `logs` directory and include detailed information about:
- Auto-selection decisions and reasoning
- File copy operations and any failures
- Match quality statistics and performance metrics
- Backup and restore operations with detailed success/failure information
