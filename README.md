# Music Indexer

A Python application for indexing and searching large music collections, with support for various audio formats, intelligent auto-selection of best matches, comprehensive backup & restore capabilities, and high-performance search optimizations.

## Features

- **Multi-format Support**: Index audio files in MP3, FLAC, M4A, AAC, and WAV formats.
- **Metadata Extraction**: Extract and store information about audio files including artist, title, album, bitrate, and duration.
- **Optional Metadata Processing**: Toggle between fast indexing (basic file info only) and complete indexing (with full audio analysis).
- **Theme Support**: Choose between Light and Dark themes to customize the application appearance.
- **Flexible Search**: Two search modes:
  - **Manual Search**: Search for music by artist, title, or general query.
  - **Automatic Search**: Match music from a text file containing artist/title pairs.
- **Smart Auto-Selection**: üÜï Automatically select the best match for each entry based on your preferences.
- **Bulk Operations**: üÜï Copy hundreds of files with a single click after auto-selection.
- **Export Missing Tracks**: üÜï Export unmatched tracks to text files for systematic follow-up searching.
- **Database Backup & Restore**: üÜï Comprehensive backup system to protect your indexed music collection.
- **High-Performance Search**: üÜï Optimized for large collections (400,000+ files) with intelligent pre-filtering and database indexing.
- **Fuzzy Matching**: Adjustable similarity threshold for flexible matching of file names and metadata.
- **Result Management**: Sort, filter, and export search results to CSV.
- **File Operations**: Copy matched files to a selected directory.
- **Cache System**: Fast indexing with SQLite-based caching of file metadata.

## üöÄ Performance Optimizations for Large Collections

The Music Indexer has been optimized to handle very large music collections efficiently:

### **Intelligent Pre-filtering**
- **Smart SQL Filtering**: Before expensive fuzzy matching, the system uses fast SQL queries to filter potential candidates
- **Keyword Extraction**: Extracts key words from search terms and matches against artist, title, and filename fields
- **Dramatic Speed Improvement**: Reduces search time from ~15 minutes to ~2-3 minutes for large collections

### **Database Indexing**
- **Optimized Indexes**: Specialized database indexes for case-insensitive LIKE queries used in pre-filtering
- **Scalable Performance**: Maintains fast search speeds even with 400,000+ indexed files
- **Automatic Index Creation**: Indexes are created automatically when the application starts

### **Performance Benchmarks**
- **Large Collection Test**: 50,000 indexed files with 31-track playlist
  - **Before optimization**: ~15 minutes
  - **After optimization**: ~2-3 minutes (5-8x speedup)
- **Expected Performance**: 400,000+ files should process playlists in under 5 minutes
- **Scalability**: Performance remains consistent as collection size grows

### **How It Works**
1. **Extract Keywords**: Break down search terms ("The Beatles - Yesterday" ‚Üí ["Beatles", "Yesterday"])
2. **SQL Pre-filtering**: Use fast database queries to find candidates containing these keywords
3. **Fuzzy Matching**: Apply expensive fuzzy matching only to filtered candidates (~100-500 files instead of 400,000)
4. **Result Optimization**: Return top matches sorted by relevance score

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **No Files Found**: Ensure your music directories are correctly configured in Settings.
- **Slow Indexing**: For large collections, use the "Extract Audio Metadata" option to toggle faster indexing without audio analysis.
- **Match Quality**: Adjust the similarity threshold in the Settings or Search tab if matches are too strict or too loose.
- **Auto-Selection Not Working**: üÜï Check that auto-selection is enabled in Settings and that your minimum score threshold isn't too high.
- **Poor Auto-Selection Results**: üÜï Adjust format preferences and score tolerance in Settings to better match your collection and preferences.
- **Bulk Copy Failures**: üÜï Ensure destination folder exists and you have write permissions. Check logs for specific error details.
- **Missing Tracks Export Empty**: üÜï This means all tracks were found! Check that you ran an automatic search (not manual search) to get missing track export option.
- **Backup Creation Fails**: üÜï Ensure you have write permissions to the backup destination and sufficient disk space.
- **Restore Operation Fails**: üÜï Verify backup integrity first, ensure the application has write permissions to database location.
- **Theme Not Applying**: If the theme doesn't change immediately, try saving settings and restarting the application.
- **Slow Search Performance**: üÜï Large collections benefit from the optimized search system. Ensure you're using the latest version with pre-filtering enabled.

### Performance Tips

- **Large Collections**: Use fast indexing mode for initial setup, then re-index with full metadata when needed
- **Large Playlists**: The optimized search system handles thousands of entries efficiently
- **Network Storage**: Local storage performs better than network-attached storage for bulk operations
- **Regular Backups**: üÜï Create backups regularly - they're much faster than re-indexing large collections
- **Incremental Indexing**: üÜï Subsequent indexing runs are much faster as they only process new/changed files
- **Missing Track Workflow**: üÜï Use export missing tracks feature to systematically improve playlist completion rates
- **Batch Processing**: üÜï Process multiple playlists, export missing tracks from each, then hunt for all missing music at once
- **Search Optimization**: üÜï The system automatically uses optimized search algorithms for collections larger than 5,000 files

### Data Protection

- **Backup Before Major Changes**: Always create a backup before upgrading, changing settings, or moving files
- **Verify Backups**: Use the "Verify Backup Integrity" feature to ensure your backups are valid
- **Multiple Backup Locations**: Store backups in different locations (local, cloud, external drive) for maximum protection
- **Test Restores**: Periodically test restore operations to ensure your backup strategy works

### Logs

Logs are stored in the `logs` directory and include detailed information about:
- Auto-selection decisions and reasoning
- File copy operations and any failures
- Match quality statistics and performance metrics
- Backup and restore operations with detailed success/failure information
- Search performance metrics and pre-filtering statistics üÜï
